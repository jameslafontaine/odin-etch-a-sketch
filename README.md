# Etch-a-Sketch

A simple Etch-a-Sketch game developed as part of The Odin Project's JavaScript Foundations section. This project showcases fundamental JavaScript skills along with CSS and HTML to create an interactive drawing grid that changes color and darkens as the user hovers over each square.

## Project Description

This project is a browser-based Etch-a-Sketch drawing app that allows users to create art by "etching" over a grid. It demonstrates the use of JavaScript for dynamically creating and styling elements, as well as for handling user interactions with the DOM.

## Features

-   **Customizable Grid**: The grid size can be customized by the user, allowing for various levels of detail.
-   **Hover Effect Drawing**: As the user hovers over each square, it changes color, simulating a drawing effect.
-   **Clear and Reset Options**: Users can reset the grid to start a new drawing.

## Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:

-   **DOM Manipulation**: Creating and managing a dynamic grid of divs in JavaScript.
-   **Event Handling**: Using `mouseenter` events to detect hover actions and apply styles. Also using `click` events to prompt the user and reset the grid.
-   **JavaScript Loops**: Looping to generate grid squares.
-   **CSS Flexbox Layout**: Structuring the grid and ensuring it resizes cleanly with various dimensions.
-   **Basic User Input**: Prompting the user for grid size and interpreting responses.

## How to Use

1. Choose the desired grid size (e.g., 16x16, 32x32, etc.) when prompted.
2. Move your mouse over the grid squares to begin drawing.
3. Use the provided button to reset the grid.

## Future Improvements

-   [ ] Implement toggles to switch between rainbow and normal mode.
-   [ ] Adding an eraser tool to allow selective removal of color.
-   [ ] Implementing a slider for easy grid size adjustments.
-   [ ] Adding a save feature to export drawings as images.
